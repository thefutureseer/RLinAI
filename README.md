### RL in AI stands for Reinforcement Learning.  
It is a type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and receiving rewards or penalties for those actions.

The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the optimal policy for an agent to take actions that maximize cumulative rewards in a given environment. The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and observing the state of the environment and the rewards or penalties received as a result of those actions. Based on this information, the agent updates its policy to take better actions in the future.

Reinforcement learning has been used to develop AI systems that can play games, navigate robots, control autonomous vehicles, and make decisions in complex environments. It is a powerful tool for developing intelligent systems that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations.
